# Inneal

Inneal is a LLM roleplay chatbot client for the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net), built for Apple devices.

# Notable Features

- [x] Beautiful native iPhone and iPad interface
- [x] Create your own chatbots or import Tavern cards from interwebs
- [x] Intuitive "swiping" feature that the kids are all talking about
- [x] Optional "Auto Mode" takes the guesswork out of using the Horde, and how!
- [x] Built with vanilla SwiftUI and SwiftData, so there's a touch of charming jank to the UX
- [ ] CloudKit syncing between all your devices (when that works better)
